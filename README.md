# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Contains three pages:
- Index (about me)
- Portfolio
- Contact

Checklist:
- Navbar
- Responsive layout
- Responsive images

Checked regularly on three viewport sizes in browser's inspect element tool: full-size, iPad, and iPhone X

Styling: based on bootstrap "info" colors, light grey background, and white forms/columns

Navbar collapses, button works, all links work. Used links to external JavaScript to make navbar button work

Used placeholder images on contact page except for SoundCloud (active link)

### NOTE: Unclear on the meaning of "sticky" footer. A true sticky footer would be relative in position until scrolled past, at which point it would become fixed. However, a footer by nature is at the bottom of the page, and can't be scrolled past. 
- Colloquially, a sticky footer would "stick" to the bottom of the viewport regardless of scroll position. This is actually called a fixed footer, which I used for this assignment.
